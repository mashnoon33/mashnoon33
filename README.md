# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Mash

NYC-based software engineer & artist making tools, interfaces, and experiments for the web. 
I treat code like a creative material â€” something to shape, explore, and communicate with.  
I believe good software should spark a strong emotional response â€” delight, clarity, even joy :))

## Currently...

- Spending time at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) â€” building weird & useful things, pairing, writing code for fun again
- Designing a **recipe CMS** cheflog ([repo](https://github.com/mashnoon33/chilioil) / [web](https://cheflog.app)) â€” versioning, validation, custom markdown, and some spicy access controls
- Prototyping a **social calendar** ([repo](https://github.com/mashnoon33/hang) / [web](https://hang.mash.studio)) â€” smart reminders, RSVP flow that makes sense, and playful design  
- Tinkering with hardware to generate analytics out of sourdough starters
